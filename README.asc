== Linux From Scratch User Package Management

Using these scripts I've supported my Linux From Scratch with User Package Management.

I'm very grateful to Linux From Scratch - I've learned a lot, but it is time to switch
to convenient distribution.

But unfortunately it is no longer educational and is just a burden to support
these scripts and build everything from code.

I don't think anyone will find these scripts useful, but I just can't delete
them, so they'll be on GitHub.

By the way I've chosen ArchLinux :)
